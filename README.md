# Library Inventory Tracker

## Description
This is a simple program designed to log and track books in a library. It allows users to input book titles, authors, and automatically counts how many copies of each book exist. It can detect duplicate entries and update the inventory accordingly.

This project is one of my first coding experiences using the C programming language and demonstrates fundamental concepts such as arrays, strings, and structures.

## Features
- Add books to the inventory by entering the title and author.
- Automatically count the number of copies of each book, updating the inventory if a duplicate entry is found.
- Display the book inventory summary with titles, authors, and the number of copies.

## Example Output

```
How many books would you like to enter? 3
Book title: Wuthering Heights
Author: Emily Brontë

Book title: Jane Eyre
Author: Charlotte Brontë

Book title: Wuthering Heights
Author: Emily Brontë

===== INVENTORY SUMMARY =====
Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë - 2 copies
Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë - 1 copy
